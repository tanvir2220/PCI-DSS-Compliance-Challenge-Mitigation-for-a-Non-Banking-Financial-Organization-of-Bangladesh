<h1>PCI DSS Compliance Challenge Mitigation for a Non-Banking Financial Organization of Bangladesh</h1>


<h2>Intoduction</h2>
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.
Being compliant with PCI DSS means that Merchants are doing their very best to keep customers valuable information safe and secure and out of the hands of people who could use that data in a fraudulent way. Not holding on to data reduces the risk that customers will be affected by fraud.
